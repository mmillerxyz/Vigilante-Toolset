## About The Project

~#: Vigilante-Toolset is a project with the goal in stopping the spread of child exploitation through TOR by finding, disabling and reporting child exploitation websites. The Concept works by proxying TOR through a localhost and then using an arsenal of the very same tools you've come to love, along with some super effective modded and original tools, against TOR websites. Every tool is automated and geared towards ease of use along with the project's specific purpose in mind. All attacks can be deployed in 7 key strokes or less. Automation designed so that anyone novice to pro can volunteer and make a difference. Don't let this tool set's easy of use fool you though, as you'll see from our YouTube channel, Vigilante-Toolset takes out TOR sites in real world/in the wild situations with easy.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Main Menu

<a href="https://github.com/MBHudson/Vigilante-Toolset/blob/master/README.md#usage"><img border="0" alt="DEMO/TUTORIAL" src="https://github.com/MBHudson/Vigilante-Toolset/blob/master/mainsmall.png" width="350" height="150" align="middle"> </a>

For each menu a corresponding number, from left to right, 1, 2, 3. You confirm your selection by the ENTER key. Typing, without quotes, "HELP" will always bring you back to the usage page. Type the letter "q" to quite from main menu.

### Menu "1"

<a href="https://github.com/MBHudson/Vigilante-Toolset/blob/master/README.md#usage"><img border="0" alt="DEMO/TUTORIAL" src="https://github.com/MBHudson/Vigilante-Toolset/blob/master/menu1.png" width="350" height="150" align="middle"> </a>

Option "1" should be your first step, this connects us to TOR and sets up to proxy. A seperate terminal will open and prompt you to enter a URL. COPY and PASTE you TARGET. without the HTTP:// or / at the end, into the terminal and press ENTER.

Press the letter "t" in any menu to access your TARGET notes. To save notes press CTRL+X (at the same time) followed by the letter "Y" and ENTER. Press the letter "b" in any menu to go back to the main menu.

### Menu "2"

<a href="https://github.com/MBHudson/Vigilante-Toolset/blob/master/README.md#usage"><img border="0" alt="DEMO/TUTORIAL" src="https://github.com/MBHudson/Vigilante-Toolset/blob/master/menu2.png" width="350" height="150" align="middle"> </a>
 
 Here we have many different tools most I'm sure you are familur with, everything is clearly labeled. For stragity and how to use these tool specificaly see [Manifesto](#Manifesto)
 
 ### Menu "3"
 
 <a href="https://github.com/MBHudson/Vigilante-Toolset/blob/master/README.md#usage"><img border="0" alt="DEMO/TUTORIAL" src="https://github.com/MBHudson/Vigilante-Toolset/blob/master/menu3.png" width="350" height="150" align="middle"> </a>
 
 The hope here is that if you're able to get evidence of someone's IP, name or location that you would be able to send the proper authorities evidence you've collected.

More to come later, sorry

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Manifesto

I have found that most of these types of sites are usually ran from an older Windows machine and often Raspberry Pi3. Minimal in power they are usually very easy to take down with DdoS attacks. I'm  working on the port scanner and crawler so for now everything is based off of what would normal be port 80. Menu 2 Option 4 finds admin logins and other things sometimes leading to the person's identity who owns the server. Brute forcing is always an option, Option 5 I believe, but I would suggest supplemental word lists. Sometime you can get lucky when searching through things found from the directory scan and happen upon a SQL server.

See the [Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UL2hAGz8_0) for features (and how to use them) More to come soon.
